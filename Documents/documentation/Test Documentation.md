# CRAWLER
In the Crawler there are presently JUnit tests which examine if the crawled data (arlines, markets, etc.) are valid.
There are no integration tests implemented.

# GUI

* *Unit Tests* were written for multiple javascript methods which control the workflow in the GUI. Only if all tests pass a new release is being deployed.
* *Code Review* Every change and commitment ist reviewed due to our PR-Workflow on github from all team members. Combined with the active linter we made sure that all standards are met.
* *Beta Test* TBA
