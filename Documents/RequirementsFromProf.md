# What do we need?

## Data!

* Destinations in Germany that are already there
* Which airlines serve these destinations? (competitors)
  * How often do they serve these destinations? -> Number of passengers
* Delay frequencies?
* Delay duration?
* Cancelation Frequency

## Graph!

* x-Axis: quantitative numbers
  * frequencies
  * passenger numbers
  * delay frequencies / durations
  * Cancelation frequencies
* y-Axis: qualitative numbers
  * time
  * day of week
  * destination
  * origin
* Filters!
  * by airlines
  * or any of the qualitative numbers

## Several analysts work on the same data!

* store settings under some kind of name
* share settings

## More stuff

* only passenger transportation is relevant
* CentOS server will be provided with MySQL database
* It's enough for the data to be available only in the office
* Should work on Win 10 Installation
* no stupid people
* time is local of the destination
* no design guidelines yet
* no authentication but identification
